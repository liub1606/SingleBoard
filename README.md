# OneBoard

OneBoard is a 19 key keyboard with a rotary encoder. It uses QMK firmware running on a RP2040.


## Features:
- 3D printed outer case
- EC11 Rotary encoder for volume and general media control.
- 19 Keys

## CAD Model:
We use 4 M3 Bolts and heatset inserts to put everything together. In total it has 2 separate peices.

## PCB
My PCB made in Kicad. I used KLE to design the keyboard layout and used a plugin to get everything laid out.

## Firmware Overview
This hackpad uses [QMK](https://qmk.fm/) firmware for everything. 

- The rotary encoder changes volume, press the encoder to pause media.
- Basically acts like the left side of a normal keyboard.
